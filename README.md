Preforming static code analysis using pylint on python code. In this case basic_network_sniffer_updated.py code.
The code attached is clean code with a score of 10/10
To get clean code I used plint for static code analysis.
Pylint is a static code analysis tool for Python that helps identify errors, enforce coding standards, and improve code quality. 
It adheres to the PEP8 style guide and assigns a score to your code based on its quality.
The image below shows the installation process of pylint using command prompt.

I used a code already running without errors on both command prompt and IDLE.
The code I used with pylint is the final updated code from my first repo; Basic network sniffer.
The code was working correctly and even could perform tracert on a domain without errors.
I thought the code would pass the pylint analysis but the code failed misserably.
The image belows shows the score. The code with this misserable score is available in my first repo.
The code attached to this repo (basic_network_sniffer_updated.py code) is clean code with a 10/10 score.
