# CodeAlpha-Secure-Coding-Review
Preforming static code analysis using pylint on python code. In this case basic_network_sniffer_updated.py code.
The code attached is clean code with a score of 10/10
To get clean code I used plint for static code analysis.
Pylint is a static code analysis tool for Python that helps identify errors, enforce coding standards, and improve code quality. 
It adheres to the PEP8 style guide and assigns a score to your code based on its quality.
I begun with a code that was already running without errors on both command prompt and IDLE
I thought my code was clean but my the first score showed it still had alot to be done to make it clean/ secure.

The image above shows the code score according to pylint. This is the same code I used for my first task and what is uploaded in my first task. 
The code I used is the final updated code from my first repo;
